# Roma Pong

I did a 2D videogame like the original PONG using Unity ```2019.3.0a4``` and the good feature is that I used a global variable to let the user choose the side to play. I know, it is not a big deal, but for me was good to learn.

## Download

You can download the [ ```APK```](https://github.com/RomarioAugustoEstradaFlorez/romapong/tree/master/Apks/Romapong.apk) to install the game.

## Installation

I use [ ```Unity Hub```](https://unity.com/es/download), choose the first option and download it, then you just have to installed and add the folder there.

Then just open and enjoy it.

Version - ```2019.3.0a4```

Language - ```C#```
